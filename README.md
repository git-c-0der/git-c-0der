### Hi there,
My name is Abhishek Maurya. I dropped out from the MNNIT Allahabad where my branch was Computer Science and pursued my graduation from Delhi University in Mathematics.
I am really looking forward to build my career in the field of Data Science especially in the Computer Vision field as this is the one field which excites me a lot from it's capabilities to perform object detection and style transfer to GAN's. I like to work on projects which provide me a lot of learning experience along with some funðŸ˜‰.
