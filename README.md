### Hi! I'm Abhishek Maurya
<hr>
I dropped out from the MNNIT Allahabad where my branch was Computer Science and pursued my graduation from Delhi University in Mathematics.
I am really looking forward to build my career in the field of Data Science especially in the Computer Vision field as this is the one field which excites me a lot from it's capabilities to perform object detection and style transfer to GAN's. I like to work on projects which provide me a lot of learning experience along with some funðŸ˜‰.


- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning GAN.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help to learn Time Series Forecasting Problems.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/His
